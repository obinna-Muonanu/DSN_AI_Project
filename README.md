https://zindi.africa/competitions/free-ai-classes-in-every-city-hackathon-2023/data
The dataset contains features such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, title (type of house), number of parking spaces, and the target (which is only present in the train dataset.).
Please download the dataset and put it in a directory before running your code.

## Dependencies
The following python packages are required to run the code:
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- CatBoost

## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the project directory
- Install the required dependencies.

To run the model with a new dataset, you can use the python script included in this repo.
Replace the csv file with the path to your dataset. The script will generate predictions for house prices based on the trained model.

## Model
The machine learning model is a regression model trained on the train dataset. The project includes a jupyter notebook: ( http://localhost:8888/notebooks/DSN%20House%20prediction.ipynb) that demonstrates the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error [RMSE]. The evaluation results can be found inside the pdf report present inside this repo.
